# C# Data Structures Tutorial

Are your algorithms lacking? Have no idea what a Linked List is? This tutorial will go over the basics of Stacks, Linked Lists, and Binary Trees.

* [Stacks](1-stack.md)
* [Linked Lists](2-linkedlist.md)
* [Binary Trees](3-tree.md)

Each section will contain a brief descriptions, common operations, and examples of how each data structure works. At the end of each module there will be a practice problem to solve. Try to solve these without looking at the [code solutions](code_solutions.md), but reference them as needed if you're stuck.
